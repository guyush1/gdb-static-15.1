## TL;DR

- **Download**: Get the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/guyush1/gdb-static/releases/latest).

## Introduction

Who doesn't love GDB? It's such a powerful tool, with such a great package.  
But sometimes, you run into one of these problems:
- You can't install GDB on your machine
- You can't install an updated version of GDB on your machine
- Some other strange embedded reasons...

This is where `gdb-static` comes in! We provide static builds of `gdb` (and `gdbserver` of course), so you can run them on any machine, without any dependencies!

<details open>
<summary>
 Features
</summary> <br />

- **Static Builds**: No dependencies, no installation, just download and run!
- **Latest Versions**: We keep our builds up-to-date with the latest versions of GDB.
- **Builtin Python (Optional)**: We provide builds with Python support built-in.
- **XML Support**: Our builds come with XML support built-in, which is useful for some GDB commands.
- **Wide Architecture Support**: We support a wide range of architectures:
  - aarch64
  - arm
  - mips
  - mipsel
  - powerpc
  - x86_64

## Usage 

To get started with `gdb-static`, simply download the build for your architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/guyush1/gdb-static/releases/latest), extract the archive, and copy the binary to your desired platform.

> [!NOTE]
> We provide two types of builds:
> 1. Builds with Python support, which are approximately ~30 MB in size.
> 2. Slimmer builds without Python support, which are approximately ~7 MB in size.

You may choose to copy the `gdb` binary to the platform, or use `gdbserver` to debug remotely.

## Development

Alternatively, you can build `gdb-static` from source. To do so, follow the instructions below:

To be able to build `gdb-static`, you will need the following tools installed on your machine:

###

- Docker
- Docker buildx
- Git

Building for a specific architecture
</summary> <br />

To build `gdb-static` for a specific architecture, run the following command:

```bash
make build[-with-python]-<ARCH>
```

Where `<ARCH>` is the architecture you want to build for, and `-with-python` may be added in order to compile gdb with Python support.

The resulting binary will be placed in the `build/artifacts/` directory:

```bash
build/
â””â”€â”€ artifacts/
    â””â”€â”€ <ARCH>/
        â””â”€â”€ ...
```

</details>

<summary>
Building for all architectures
</summary> <br />

To build `gdb-static` for all supported architectures, run the following command:

```bash
make build
```

The resulting binary will be placed in the `build/artifacts/` directory.
